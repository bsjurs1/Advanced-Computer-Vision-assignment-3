If one is to be able to utilize the same kernel size for all the meanshift procedures in the feature space, a condition that needs to be met is that the local density variations near a significant mode are not as big as the entire support of a significant mode somewhere else. So if the local density variations near a significant mode are as large as the entire support of a significant mode somewhere else then one has to use different kernels for each feature.
