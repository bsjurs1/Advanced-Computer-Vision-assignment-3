"""Question 1."""

"""
This requires implementing the marker-based watershed method -
Meyerâ€™s Flooding or immersion method--as discussed in class.
Ready made function calls to watersheds should not be used
in the implementation. It is a good idea to first test the method on very
small images (say 4x4 or 8x8) to make sure that you dont have bugs.
Remember to compute the gradient image and perform the
flooding on the gradient image!."""
